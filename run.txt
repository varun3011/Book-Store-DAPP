                    BOOK STORE DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION (DApp)
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
A decentralized book marketplace built on Ethereum blockchain where users can:
- Buy books from the store
- Sell their purchased books to other users
- Track ownership and purchase history

TECHNOLOGY STACK
----------------
- Frontend: Next.js 13, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- Blockchain: Solidity (Smart Contracts), Hardhat (Development)
- Wallet: MetaMask (Ethereum wallet integration)
- Network: Local Hardhat blockchain (localhost:8545)

MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES
--------------------

1. ADD BOOKS (Account #1 Only)
   - Only Account #1 can add new books to the store
   - Requires: Title, Author, Price (ETH), Stock quantity, Image URL
   - Books are stored on the blockchain permanently

2. PURCHASE FROM STORE
   - Any user can buy books directly from the store
   - Payment in ETH (automatic calculation: price × quantity)
   - Stock decreases automatically
   - Ownership is tracked on blockchain

3. PEER-TO-PEER MARKETPLACE
   - Users can list their purchased books for sale
   - Set custom price (can be different from original price)
   - Other users can buy from these listings
   - Ownership transfers automatically on purchase

4. USER PROFILE
   - View all owned books
   - See purchase history and prices paid
   - Track active listings
   - Statistics: Total books owned, total value

5. BOOK MANAGEMENT
   - List books for sale
   - Update listing price/quantity
   - Cancel listings
   - View marketplace listings

HOW IT WORKS (MAIN LOGIC)
--------------------------

SMART CONTRACT (BookStore.sol):
- Stores all book data on blockchain (immutable)
- Tracks ownership: bookId → address → quantity owned
- Manages listings: bookId → seller → listing details
- Records purchase history for each book
- Enforces rules: Only Account #1 can add books

OWNERSHIP TRACKING:
- When user buys from store: ownership increases
- When user sells to another: ownership decreases
- Each transaction is recorded on blockchain
- Purchase price is tracked per user per book

MARKETPLACE LOGIC:
1. User lists book → Creates listing with price & quantity
2. Another user buys → Ownership transfers, payment sent to seller
3. Listing quantity decreases (or removed if all sold)
4. Original listing price is used (not store price)

FRONTEND LOGIC:
- Connects to MetaMask wallet
- Reads data from smart contract
- Displays books in card-based UI
- Handles transactions through MetaMask
- Auto-refreshes after transactions

KEY FEATURES
------------
✓ Decentralized (no central server, data on blockchain)
✓ Ownership tracking (know who owns what)
✓ Peer-to-peer trading (users sell to each other)
✓ Price history (tracks what users paid)
✓ Image support (book covers via URLs)
✓ Real-time updates (automatic refresh after transactions)

SECURITY FEATURES
-----------------
- Only Account #1 can add books (access control)
- Ownership verification before listing
- Stock validation before purchase
- Payment verification (sufficient funds check)
- Automatic refunds for excess payments

DATA STORAGE
------------
All data stored on blockchain:
- Book catalog (title, author, price, stock, image)
- Ownership records (who owns how many copies)
- Purchase history (all transactions)
- Active listings (marketplace offers)
- Purchase prices (what each user paid)

NETWORK CONFIGURATION
---------------------
- Network: Hardhat Local
- RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
- Chain ID: 31337
- Currency: ETH (test tokens)

QUICK START
-----------
1. Start Hardhat node: npx hardhat node
2. Deploy contract: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
3. Start frontend: npm run dev
4. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
5. Connect MetaMask to Hardhat network
6. Use Account #1 to add books
